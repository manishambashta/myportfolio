# Professional Statement
I get fulfillment upon solving problems. I like to invest time to research and learn to develop platforms that will be useful. Cybersecurity interests me more because of the wide nature of knowledge it requires to work in this domain. For me there's a lot to unearth and explore the fascinating implementation that is already done in the field of computers and internet. When I learn and research, I found the moment that connect the dots very fascinating. It gives more sense in working with any implementation, once you have more understanding of it. I am interested in developing the platform/tools that can be used in cybersecurity domain.
